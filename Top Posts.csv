38,Fucking Customers,"Today I was asked if I could stay an hour extra since we were short on cashiers.  I stayed until 5:00 PM and a little before I was ready to leave this bitch comes in my line.  To set the tone this lady was in our store yelling for about two hours in one of the service areas.

I was on the Smoke Shop and I am one of the faster cashiers and was finishing up helping this elderly gentlemen make sure he got his bags.  This bitch as I'm getting his stuff has the nerve to tell me that I made her miss her public transportation.  Um?  No you did that yourself by not using time management.

She then has the nerve to say well since you made me miss the bus I'll make the line back up and then tells me to double bag all of her stuff which wasn't even worthy of being double bagged.  She then roots through her change and says I'll go slow as possible to make your line longer (something to that extent).  I finally had enough.  I said it's not my fault you missed your bus, I don't make my customers rush to get out of my line, and you should be glad I stayed to even help with cashiering.  I am tired of these customers thinking we're doormats and they can walk all over us.  She then was like I don't need your dissertation.  Well maybe learn what words mean before you say them, because a dissertation is something you write for college LOL!

97,"Got reported :,)","I was stocking groceries for the entire day and decided to put in one of my airpods to make the day go by faster. I ended up calling one of my friends while doing my jobs (and essentially showing them what I do for a living) until I got stopped by this old guy. The conversation goes as following:

Old Guy: Excuse me, (name), are you on break?
Me: Nope. Just stocking.
Old Guy: You shouldn‚Äôt be talking to anyone while stocking.
Me: Alright, sorry about that.

I showed him that I hung up and thought that was the end of it, but BOY was I wrong.

One of the people working with him pulls me aside and tells me that if old guy catches me on my phone again, he‚Äôs gonna report me. Keep in mind: this guy HATES old guy, so we kinda just laugh it off.

The minute I go back to stocking, all my coworkers tell me that Old Guy told everyone he reported me. Not only that, but he followed us around non-stop while pretending to zone.

I hit my limit and clocked out early. I already talked to a manager, so I‚Äôm covered. The whole situation kinda pissed me off though, so I just wanted to vent.

I noticed she didn‚Äôt leave the aisle after I left. So I waited a second and then peeked back down the aisle.
